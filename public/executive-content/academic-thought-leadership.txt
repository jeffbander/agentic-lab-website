# Agentic AI in Clinical Practice: Evidence-Based Implementation at Academic Medical Centers

**Authors:** [Leadership Team, Department of Medicine and Clinical Informatics, Mount Sinai Health System]

## Abstract

**Background:** Agentic artificial intelligence systems—autonomous AI capable of multi-step reasoning, tool use, and adaptive decision-making—represent a paradigmatic shift from previous clinical decision support systems. As academic medical centers (AMCs) navigate implementation, rigorous validation methodologies and evidence-based frameworks are essential.

**Methods:** We present a comprehensive framework for clinical validation of agentic AI systems, drawing from implementation science and our institutional experience at Mount Sinai West. We conducted a systematic analysis of validation requirements across diagnostic reasoning, treatment planning, and population health management applications.

**Results:** Evidence-based implementation requires four validation pillars: algorithmic validation (sensitivity/specificity, AUC-ROC analysis), clinical workflow integration studies, prospective outcomes measurement, and equity impact assessment. Early data from controlled implementations demonstrate measurable improvements in diagnostic accuracy (5-12% reduction in missed diagnoses), care coordination efficiency (18-24% reduction in time-to-treatment), and clinician cognitive load (p<0.01).

**Conclusions:** Successful integration of agentic AI into academic medicine demands methodological rigor comparable to pharmaceutical trials, adaptive governance structures, and sustained commitment to health equity. AMCs must lead in establishing evidence standards that balance innovation with patient safety while training the next generation of AI-literate clinicians.

## Introduction

The evolution of artificial intelligence in medicine has reached an inflection point. Where previous AI applications functioned as sophisticated pattern-recognition tools requiring continuous human oversight, agentic AI systems possess the capability for autonomous multi-step reasoning, environmental sensing, tool orchestration, and adaptive learning from feedback loops.^1,2^ This technological advancement demands equally sophisticated clinical validation frameworks.

Academic medical centers stand at the crossroads of innovation and evidence-based practice. Our role extends beyond early adoption to encompass rigorous evaluation, medical education transformation, and establishment of implementation standards that will guide community hospitals and health systems nationwide. The stakes are considerable: premature deployment risks patient safety and erodes trust; excessive caution delays potentially life-saving innovations and widens existing care gaps.

This perspective presents a structured approach to evidence-based implementation of agentic AI, synthesizing principles from clinical trial design, implementation science, health services research, and biomedical ethics. We draw upon our institutional experience at Mount Sinai West, a 514-bed quaternary care academic medical center serving a demographically diverse patient population in Manhattan, to illustrate practical applications and methodological considerations.

## Defining Agentic AI: Beyond Decision Support

Precise terminology is essential for scientific discourse. We define agentic AI systems as possessing four core capabilities:

**1. Multi-step autonomous reasoning:** The capacity to decompose complex clinical problems, generate differential diagnoses, sequence diagnostic workups, and synthesize information across multiple encounters without step-by-step human direction.

**2. Tool use and integration:** Ability to query electronic health records, laboratory information systems, medical literature databases, and clinical calculators while appropriately weighting evidence quality.

**3. Adaptive learning:** Incorporation of feedback from clinical outcomes, provider input, and population-level performance metrics to refine decision-making algorithms.

**4. Contextual awareness:** Recognition of practice environment constraints including resource availability, patient preferences, social determinants of health, and institutional protocols.

This definition distinguishes agentic AI from predictive analytics tools (which identify risk but do not recommend actions), clinical decision support alerts (which apply predetermined rules), and narrow AI applications (which perform isolated tasks like image classification).

The distinction carries methodological implications. Validation of pattern-recognition algorithms focuses on sensitivity, specificity, and generalizability across populations. Agentic systems require evaluation of reasoning processes, appropriateness of sequential decisions, and integration quality across the care continuum.^3^

## Clinical Validation Framework: Four Essential Pillars

### Pillar 1: Algorithmic Validation

Algorithmic performance represents the foundation, but not the entirety, of clinical validation. We propose stratified assessment across three domains:

**Technical Performance Metrics:**
- Discrimination: AUC-ROC curves for risk prediction tasks
- Calibration: Agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes across risk strata
- Decision curve analysis: Net benefit compared to alternative strategies across probability thresholds^4^

**Clinical Reasoning Assessment:**
For agentic systems performing diagnostic or therapeutic reasoning, we recommend structured evaluation using validated frameworks:
- Differential diagnosis completeness (comparison to expert-generated lists)
- Clinical reasoning coherence (evaluation by board-certified specialists)
- Evidence appropriateness (assessment of citations and guideline adherence)
- Recognition of diagnostic uncertainty and appropriate escalation^5^

**Edge Case Performance:**
Deliberate testing with diagnostically complex cases, atypical presentations, and scenarios involving multiple comorbidities ensures the system recognizes its limitations—a critical safety feature often overlooked in validation protocols.

At Mount Sinai West, we developed a 500-case validation library spanning common presentations, rare diagnoses, and diagnostic dilemmas previously reviewed at morbidity and mortality conferences. Agentic AI systems undergo evaluation by disease-specific expert panels before clinical deployment, with performance benchmarked against diagnostic accuracy from initial emergency department or primary care evaluations.

### Pillar 2: Clinical Workflow Integration Studies

Algorithmic accuracy is necessary but insufficient. Healthcare delivery occurs within complex sociotechnical systems where the same technology can improve or deteriorate outcomes depending on implementation context.^6^

**Time-Motion Studies:**
Prospective observation of clinical workflows pre- and post-implementation quantifies impact on:
- Time spent on documentation versus direct patient care
- Cognitive interruptions and context-switching frequency
- Coordination efficiency among multidisciplinary teams

**Usability Assessment:**
Systematic evaluation using frameworks like the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Technology Acceptance Model identifies friction points before widespread deployment. Our institutional experience revealed that even highly accurate systems face resistance when interfaces require more than 30 seconds to access or generate recommendations exceeding 200 words—findings that fundamentally reshaped our procurement requirements.

**Alert Fatigue and Override Patterns:**
We implement comprehensive monitoring of recommendation acceptance rates, override reasons (requiring structured documentation), and correlation between override frequency and patient outcomes. Alert fatigue represents a well-documented phenomenon; acceptance rates below 50% suggest poor recommendation specificity or inadequate clinical integration.^7^

### Pillar 3: Prospective Outcomes Measurement

The ultimate validation criterion is patient-centered outcomes. We advocate for pragmatic, cluster-randomized implementation trials applying principles from comparative effectiveness research.

**Study Design Considerations:**

*Randomization at appropriate levels:* Given workflow integration requirements, cluster randomization by clinical unit, service line, or time period (stepped-wedge designs) often proves more feasible than individual patient randomization.

*Outcomes selection:* Composite endpoints should include:
- **Clinical efficacy:** Diagnostic accuracy, time-to-appropriate treatment, preventable adverse events, 30-day readmissions
- **Efficiency:** Length of stay, resource utilization, emergency department throughput
- **Experience:** Patient satisfaction, clinician burnout metrics, trust in recommendations
- **Equity:** Subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity, language, socioeconomic status, insurance type

*Power calculations:* Many anticipated effects (5-10% relative improvements) require sample sizes of 500-2,000 patients per arm to achieve 80% power. Multi-center collaborations may be necessary for adequate statistical power, particularly for rare outcomes.

*Duration:* Minimum 6-month implementation periods allow for learning curves, workflow stabilization, and seasonal variation capture.

**Mount Sinai West Illustrative Study:**

We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial evaluating an agentic AI system for sepsis recognition and treatment protocol initiation across four medical-surgical units (n=1,847 patients, 12-month study period). Primary outcome was time from first organ dysfunction to protocol-appropriate antibiotic administration.

Results demonstrated 42-minute reduction in time-to-antibiotics (95% CI: 28-56 minutes, p<0.001), with 18% relative reduction in progression to septic shock (RR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71-0.95, p=0.008). Importantly, subgroup analysis revealed consistent benefits across racial/ethnic groups, and post-implementation clinician surveys showed high acceptance (89% agreement that the system improved care quality) without increased burnout scores.^8^

### Pillar 4: Equity Impact Assessment

Healthcare AI systems have demonstrated disturbing capacity to perpetuate or amplify existing disparities.^9,10^ Academic medical centers bear particular responsibility for proactive equity assessment given our patient populations and societal mission.

**Pre-implementation Requirements:**

*Training data representativeness:* Demographic composition of training datasets should reflect target implementation population. Subgroup performance should be evaluated with adequate sample sizes—not simply reported as "limitations."

*Feature bias audit:* Systematic review of input variables for proxies of
