**Note:** Since Sora 2 is not yet publicly available (as of January 2025), you may need to waitlist or use OpenAI enterprise access. Alternative options include stock footage compilation or hiring a videographer to shoot at Mount Sinai West Hospital with proper permissions.

For immediate use, I recommend creating a simple animated logo intro with the official Mount Sinai logo and overlaying it on stock medical footage until Sora 2 becomes available.
