**RE: Invitation to Join the Agentic Laboratory Technical Advisory Board**

---

Dear [RECIPIENT NAME],

I am writing to personally invite you to join the Technical Advisory Board of the Agentic Laboratory at Mount Sinai West Hospital. You have been specifically identified as a leader at the intersection of healthcare and technology, and your expertise would be invaluable as we shape the future of clinician-led software development.

## About the Agentic Laboratory

The Agentic Laboratory is pioneering a new model for healthcare technology development -- one where clinicians, not just engineers, build production-grade software using multi-agent AI systems. Operating under the Mount Sinai Health System, we have demonstrated that physician-developers, working with orchestrated AI agents, can deliver secure, HIPAA-compliant applications in weeks rather than the months or years traditional development cycles require.

Our results speak to the significance of this work:

- **5+ production applications** deployed within a major health system
- **92%+ AI-assisted code generation** with rigorous human-in-the-loop oversight
- **$1.5M+ in documented cost savings** across projects
- **2-6 week deployment cycles** for clinical-grade software

We believe we are at an inflection point in healthcare technology. The convergence of large language models, multi-agent orchestration frameworks, and clinician domain expertise is creating an unprecedented opportunity to fundamentally reimagine how healthcare software is conceived, built, and maintained. The implications extend well beyond our laboratory -- this model has the potential to transform how every hospital system, research institution, and healthcare organization approaches technology development.

## Why You

After careful consideration, our leadership team has identified you as one of a select group of individuals whose unique combination of technical depth and healthcare domain understanding positions you to provide extraordinary strategic guidance. Whether through your contributions to [SPECIFIC AREA OF RECIPIENT'S EXPERTISE], your leadership in [SPECIFIC ROLE/ORGANIZATION], or your recognized work in [SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT], you represent exactly the caliber of thinking we need on this board.

We are assembling an advisory board of no more than six members -- deliberately small to ensure meaningful engagement, substantive discussion, and real strategic impact.

## The Opportunity

As a member of the Technical Advisory Board, you would provide high-level strategic counsel on:

- **Technology Stack and Architecture** -- Guidance on our core technology decisions, including AI orchestration frameworks, model selection, infrastructure, and security architecture for healthcare environments
- **Agentic Coding Strategy** -- Strategic direction on the future of multi-agent AI development, prompt engineering methodologies, human-in-the-loop workflows, and the evolving landscape of AI-assisted software creation
- **Project and Architecture Oversight** -- High-level review of our project portfolio, architectural decisions, scalability planning, and technical risk assessment
- **Healthcare AI Governance** -- Counsel on responsible AI deployment in clinical settings, regulatory compliance (HIPAA, FDA software guidance), bias monitoring, and patient safety considerations
- **Growth and Partnerships** -- Strategic advice on partnerships, talent acquisition, research collaborations, and opportunities to expand the clinician-developer model

## Commitment and Compensation

This is a **paid advisory position**. We respect your time and expertise, and our compensation structure reflects that:

- **Quarterly Meetings:** Four structured advisory board meetings per year (approximately 2 hours each), held via video conference with an optional annual in-person session in New York City
- **Between-Meeting Availability:** Occasional email or brief call consultations as needed, estimated at 3-5 hours per quarter beyond formal meetings
- **Total Time Commitment:** Approximately 12-15 hours per quarter
- **Compensation:** A quarterly cash retainer of **$[AMOUNT]**, paid at the beginning of each quarter
- **Expense Reimbursement:** Reasonable travel and related expenses for any in-person meetings will be fully reimbursed
- **Term:** Initial appointment of one (1) year, with automatic annual renewal thereafter

Full details of the compensation, confidentiality obligations, intellectual property provisions, and other terms are set forth in the enclosed Advisory Board Agreement.

## Next Steps

If you are interested in this opportunity -- and I sincerely hope you are -- I would welcome the chance to speak with you directly to discuss the role in more detail, answer any questions, and share our vision for where this work is headed.

Please feel free to reach out to me at [EMAIL] or [PHONE] to schedule a conversation at your convenience. Alternatively, you may reply directly to this letter with any initial questions.

We would ask that you indicate your interest by **[RESPONSE DEADLINE]**, so that we may finalize the board composition and schedule our inaugural meeting for **[TARGET Q1 MEETING DATE]**.

## Closing

Healthcare is entering a period of profound technological transformation. The question is no longer whether AI will reshape how clinical software is built, but who will guide that transformation responsibly. I believe you are one of the people who should be at that table.

I look forward to the possibility of working with you.

With respect and appreciation,
